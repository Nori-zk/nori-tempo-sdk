/**
 * Starts reading a proven request's witness through the Ethereum
 * connection: its batch's requests, read once from the queue's logs and
 * storage, rebuilt into the batch's Merkle tree and checked against the
 * committed root (a mismatch is a failed read,
 * `ProofRequestWitnessRootMismatchError`).
 *
 * @param connections The Ethereum and Tempo chains, with their running connectivity machines.
 * @param proofQueueAddress The `NoriProofRequestQueue` address.
 * @param proofAvailable The request's proof available snapshot.
 * @param backoff How long a failed read waits before reading again.
 * @returns The running machine; `current` carries `witness` and `verifiedWitness`. Its controls:
 *   - `retry()`: reads again now, without waiting, while failed.
 *   - `close()`: moves the machine to `closed`.
