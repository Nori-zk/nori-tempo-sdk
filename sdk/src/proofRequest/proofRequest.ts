/**
 * Follows one Ethereum proof request until a committed proof queue batch on
 * Tempo covers it: its snapshot, read through the connections
 * (`readThroughConnectionsOf`), until the proof is available.
 * `proofRequestTxHash`, the transaction that enqueued the request, is its
 * starting data, carried by every node.
 *
 * - `loading` looks the request up from the transaction that enqueued it.
 *   A transaction that is not mined yet is not a failure: the snapshot
 *   stays `undetermined`, and `transaction` holds the transaction as the
 *   last read found it (`transactionFollow$`).
 * - `current` holds the snapshot while no batch covers the request. An
 *   `undetermined` one is looked up again, and an `unprocessed` one read
 *   again (`refreshing`), every poll interval or recheck signal.
 * - A read that finds a committed batch covering the request moves to
 *   `proofAvailable` (`discoveredProofAvailable` from `loading`,
 *   `proofRequestCommitted` from `refreshing`), which holds the snapshot
 *   with that batch. It is terminal: batches are append-only, so the request
 *   stays covered.
 * - The enqueuing transaction never mined: `transactionReplaced` once its
 *   sender's mined nonce moved past its own, `transactionDropped` once the
 *   node has not known it for the blocks allowed. Both are terminal: the
 *   request was never enqueued.
 * - `closed` is terminal too.
