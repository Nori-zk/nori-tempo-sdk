/**
 * One transaction sent through the user's wallet, made for one call and
 * sent on a send request, then followed on the chain until it ends
 * (`sentTransactionOf`). A send request is gated on the wallet being ready.
 *
 * - `askingToSign`: the wallet shows the transaction; one request per
 *   entry. Its outcomes: `sent` with the transaction's hash, sender and
 *   nonce, to `loading`; the user said no, to `declined`; the contract
 *   reverted it at gas estimation, to `refused` with the revert's name; the
 *   wallet failing for any other reason, or dropping while asking, to
 *   `sendFailed` with the error.
 * - `declined` accepts a send request again, through the same gate.
 * - The wallet picks the nonce itself, so a send again after a drop cannot
 *   pin it; only the blocks the node has not known it for tell a drop.
