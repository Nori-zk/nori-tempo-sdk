/**
 * The user's Ethereum wallet, when reads go through it (the app gave no
 * Ethereum RPC URL): whether there is one, which one, whether it is on the
 * proof request queue's chain, and whether reads through it work. Every
 * node that keeps reads from running carries what the app needs to tell
 * the user why, and none is a dead end.
 *
 * `checking`, `ready`, `wrongNetwork`, `unreachable`, `offline` and `closed`,
 * with their edges, are `healthCheckedOf`'s, each live node carrying the
 * wallet, so reads gate on the wallet exactly as on an HTTP connection. For
 * a wallet, `url` is its reverse-DNS id. Unlike an HTTP endpoint, a wallet
 * on another chain is not checked again on a timer: it waits for the user
 * to change chain.
 *
 * - `lookingForWallets` asks wallets to announce themselves (EIP-6963
 *   `eip6963:requestProvider`), also accepting a legacy `window.ethereum`,
 *   for a short window. Its three outcome edges race on that one search.
 * - `noWalletFound`: there is no wallet to read through; the app can ask
 *   the user to install one. A wallet announcing itself later (installed or
 *   enabled) moves straight to `checking`.
 * - `choosingWallet`: several wallets are installed. The app lists them
 *   and calls `chooseWallet(uuid)`; wallets announcing themselves meanwhile
 *   join the list. With one wallet there is no choice to make.
 * - `checking` asks the wallet for its chain (`eth_chainId`), then its
 *   latest block (`eth_blockNumber`). A wallet that does not answer goes to
 *   `unreachable`, which asks again after a wait that doubles with each
 *   consecutive failure (`failedChecks`, reset by an answer).
 * - `ready` runs a background check every interval; a passing one is the
 *   `stillReady` self-loop, carrying the latest block. A read that fails
 *   through the wallet sends `readFailed`: `ready` to `checking` at once.
 * - `wrongNetwork`: the wallet is on another chain. The app can tell the
 *   user which chain to switch to, and may ask the wallet to switch, once:
 *   `switchToExpectedChain` moves to `askingToSwitchChain`, whose `$` sends
 *   one `wallet_switchEthereumChain` request. Accepting arrives as a normal
 *   chain change. Declining (the wallet's user-rejected error, code 4001)
 *   moves to `switchDeclined`, which has no `switchToExpectedChain` edge, so
 *   the user is not asked again until they change chain themselves. A
 *   request the wallet fails for any other reason goes back to
 *   `wrongNetwork` with the wallet's error in `lastSwitchError`, and the app
 *   may ask again.
 * - Any chain change, from any node with a wallet, checks again.
 * - The wallet's `disconnect` (it can reach no chain) moves to
 *   `unreachable`; its `connect` checks again at once.
 * - Going offline pauses everything in `offline`; coming back online checks
 *   at once.
 * - `closed` ends the machine from any node and completes its streams.
