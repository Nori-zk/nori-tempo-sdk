/**
 * Follows one Ethereum proof request until a committed proof queue batch on
 * Tempo covers it, reading through the Ethereum and Tempo connectivity
 * machines. Nothing is a dead end: lost connections are waited for and
 * failures retry themselves.
 *
 * - `undetermined` looks the request up from the transaction that enqueued
 *   it, on entry and then every poll interval or recheck signal. A
 *   transaction that is not mined yet is not a failure: it keeps looking.
 *   Its outcomes race on one shared lookup: `unprocessed`,
 *   `proofAvailable`, a lost connection, or a failure.
 * - `unprocessed` checks the bridge on entry and then every poll interval or
 *   recheck signal, until a committed batch covers the request.
 * - A read that fails to reach a connection reports it to that connection,
 *   which re-checks itself, and the machine stays where it is until the
 *   check settles: a connection that turns out to be down is
 *   `connectionLost`; one that passes straight back to `ready` means the read
 *   itself failed: `readFailedOnHealthyConnection`.
 * - `waitingForConnection…` names the connections it waits on in
 *   `waitingOn`, updated as they change, and resumes where it was once both
 *   are `ready`. The lost and failed nodes are split by where they resume,
 *   because an edge's target is fixed.
 * - `failed…` reads again by itself after a wait that doubles with each
 *   consecutive failure (`failedReads`), or at once on `retry`. A read that
 *   succeeds resets `failedReads`.
 * - `proofAvailable` is terminal: once a batch covers the request it stays
 *   covered (batches are append-only). `closed` is terminal too.
