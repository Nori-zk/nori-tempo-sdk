 *
 * @param connections The Ethereum and Tempo chains, with their running connectivity machines.
 * @param proofQueueAddress The `NoriProofRequestQueue` address.
 * @param batch The batch.
 * @param query The submitting address and the lowest block.

 * @returns The running machine; `current` carries the requests. Its controls:
 *   - `retry()`: reads again now, without waiting, while failed.
 *   - `close()`: moves the machine to `closed`.
