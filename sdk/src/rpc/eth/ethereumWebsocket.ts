/**
 * Opens an Ethereum node's reconnecting websocket (a `wss://` RPC URL). Its
 * subscriptions are the topics of `topics.ts`; its requests go through an
 * ethers provider over the same socket, matched to their replies by request
 * id, on the expected chain (ethers never detects it). A request the socket
 * cannot carry, or that gets no reply within the health check timeout, fails
 * as disconnected.
 *
 * @param config The websocket URL, the attempts allowed and the timings.
 * @param network The running network machine the connection follows.
 * @param expectedChainId The chain the proof request queue lives on.
 * @returns
 *   - `socket`: the reconnecting websocket.
 *   - `connection`: its running connection machine.
 *   - `current()`: the ethers provider whose requests go over the socket.
 *   - `close()`: closes the socket and moves the machine to `closed`.
