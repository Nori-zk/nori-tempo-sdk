/**
 * Starts reading a transaction's receipt through one chain's connection,
 * and reading it again on each new block of that chain until it is mined.
 *
 * @param connections The Ethereum and Tempo chains, with their running connectivity machines.
 * @param chain The chain the transaction was sent on.
 * @param transactionHash The transaction.
 * @param backoff How long a failed read waits before reading again.
 * @returns The running machine; `current` carries the receipt once mined. Its controls:
 *   - `retry()`: reads again now, without waiting, while failed.
 *   - `close()`: moves the machine to `closed`.
