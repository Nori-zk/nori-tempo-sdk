/**
 * A live view of a submitting address's newest N proof requests, newest
 * first, reading through the Ethereum and Tempo connectivity
 * machines. It never ends on its own and nothing is a dead end: lost
 * connections are waited for and failures retry themselves.
 *
 * - `loading` reads the newest N from `fromBlock`. It carries the view
 *   already on screen: empty before the first view, the last view while
 *   reloading after a reorg. So do the other `…BeforeFirstView` nodes.
 * - `watching` shows the view until a refresh is due: every interval, or on
 *   the recheck signal (e.g. bridge state changes from the websocket).
 * - `refreshing` re-reads from the view's oldest block up to the latest
 *   block. Its outcomes race on one shared read: `refreshArrived` (new
 *   requests enter at the top and states move from unprocessed to proof
 *   available; every refresh emits the fresh view), `requestsMissing` (a
 *   reorg removed a request in the view: load everything again from
 *   `fromBlock`), `connectionLost`, `readFailedOnHealthyConnection` or
 *   `readFailed`.
 * - A read that fails to reach a connection reports it to that connection,
 *   which re-checks itself, and the machine stays where it is until the
 *   check settles: a connection that turns out to be down is
 *   `connectionLost`; one that passes straight back to `ready` means the
 *   read itself failed: `readFailedOnHealthyConnection`.
 * - `waitingForConnection…` names the connections it waits on in
 *   `waitingOn`, updated as they change, and resumes once both are `ready`.
 * - `failed…` reads again by itself after a wait that doubles with each
 *   consecutive failure (`failedReads`), or at once on `retry`. A read that
 *   arrives resets `failedReads`.
 * - `closed` is terminal.
