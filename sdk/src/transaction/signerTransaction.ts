 * until it ends (`sentTransactionOf`). A send request is gated on the
 * chain's connection.
 *
 * - `sending`: the signer signs and sends it; one send per entry, with its
 *   pinned nonce after a drop. Its outcomes: `sent` with the transaction's
 *   hash, sender and nonce, to `loading`; the contract reverted it at gas
 *   estimation, to `refused` with the revert's name (e.g. `PauseNotNewer`);
 *   any other failure (the signer's node unreachable, a nonce clash), to
 *   `sendFailed` with the error.
