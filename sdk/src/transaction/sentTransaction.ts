/**
 * One transaction, made for one call and sent only on a send request, then
 * followed on the chain until it ends. Every transaction machine spreads
 * these nodes and edges and adds its own `sending` node (the node that sends
 * it, named by the machine) and that node's outcomes.
 *
 * - `ready` holds the transaction until a send request. The request is
 *   gated on what sends it (the wallet, or the chain's connection): usable,
 *   it moves to `sending`; not usable, to `notReadyToSend`, naming what it
 *   waits on in `waitingOn`. That node goes back to `ready` once it is
 *   usable, or on `dismiss`; it never sends by itself.
 * - `refused`: the contract reverted it at gas estimation (`errorName`).
 *   `sendFailed`: anything else kept it from being sent (`error`). Both
 *   accept a send request again, through the same gate.
 * - From `loading` on, it is followed through the chain's connection
 *   (`readThroughConnectionsOf`) on each new block: `current` holds it sent
 *   and not mined. Each read reads the sender's mined nonce first, then the
 *   receipt, then whether the node knows the transaction.
 * - It ends `confirmed` or `reverted` once mined, with its receipt;
 *   `replaced` once the sender's mined nonce moved past its own with no
 *   receipt for it (another transaction took its nonce); or `dropped` once
 *   the node has not known it for a number of blocks (`unknownSinceBlock`).
 *   `dropped` accepts a send request again, with its nonce pinned, so only
 *   one of the two can land.
 * - `confirmed`, `reverted`, `replaced` and `closed` are terminal.
 *
 * @param sending The machine's node that sends the transaction.
 * @returns The nodes and edges.
