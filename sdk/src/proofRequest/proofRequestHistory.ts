/**
 * Pages through a submitting address's proof requests, reading through the
 * Ethereum and Tempo connectivity machines. Nothing is a dead
 * end: lost connections are waited for and failures retry themselves.
 *
 * - `loadingPage` reads one page from `cursor`. The read's outcomes race on
 *   one shared read: `pageArrived`, `lastPageArrived` (the block range is
 *   exhausted), `connectionLost`, `readFailedOnHealthyConnection` or
 *   `pageFailed`.
 * - A read that fails to reach a connection reports it to that connection,
 *   which re-checks itself, and the machine stays in `loadingPage` until the
 *   check settles: a connection that turns out to be down is
 *   `connectionLost`; one that passes straight back to `ready` means the read
 *   itself failed: `readFailedOnHealthyConnection`.
 * - A connection that is not `ready` when a page starts, or leaves `ready`
 *   during it, is `connectionLost` too.
 * - `waitingForConnection` names the connections it waits on in `waitingOn`,
 *   updated as they change (the `connectionsChanged` self-loop), so the app
 *   can show the right message alongside those connections' own states. It
 *   resumes from the saved cursor once both are `ready`.
 * - `failed` reads again by itself after a wait that doubles with each
 *   consecutive failure (`failedReads`), or at once on `retry`. A page that
 *   arrives resets `failedReads`.
 * - Loss of a connection is only noticed while loading: `waitingForMore`
 *   does no reads, and a `loadMore` while a connection is down moves to
 *   `loadingPage`, which reports the loss straight away.
 * - `allLoaded` and `closed` are terminal.
