 *
 * - `loading` reads the first page; `current` holds the requests loaded so
 *   far and the cursor after them; `loadMore` refreshes them with the next
 *   page (`refreshing`), appended to `loaded`.
 * - The page that exhausts the block range moves to `allLoaded`
 *   (`lastPageLoaded`), from `loading` or `refreshing`.
 * - Loss of a connection is only noticed while reading: `current` does no
 *   reads, and a `loadMore` while a connection is down moves to
 *   `refreshing`, which reports the loss straight away.
 * - `allLoaded` and `closed` are terminal.
